# Timopheevii-Lineage-Genomics
This repository contains the scripts and code used to analyze the genomic datasets generated for the project "Evolutionary Dynamics of the ‘Unsuccessful’ Timopheevii Wheat Lineage."
We assembled the genomes of Triticum timopheevii and T. zhukovskyi, analyzed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of T. timopheevii, and generated skim-seq data for both T. zhukovskyi and T. monococcum.
