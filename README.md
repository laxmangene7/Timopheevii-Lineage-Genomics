# Timopheevii-Lineage-Genomics
Script and codes used to analyzed genomics dataset gnerated for the project Evolutionary Dynamics of the ‘Unsuccessful’ Timopheevii Wheat Lineage are presented here. We have generated genome assemblies of Triticum. timopheevii and T. zhukovskyi, analyzed WGS of T. timopheevii and also generated skim-seq in T. zhukovskyi and timococcum.
